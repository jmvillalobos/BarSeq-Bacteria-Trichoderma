# BarSeq-Bacteria-Trichoderma

### By Manuel Villalobos
UC Berkeley-LBNL



This GitHub is to put all the generated scripts for the BarSeq analysis generated in the Trichoderma/bacteria interaction project. 
This was done in the laboratory of Dr. Adam Deutschbauer and Dr. Louise Glass. These scripts are run once fitness tables are received 
for each of the 4 bacteria on which the experiments were run.
